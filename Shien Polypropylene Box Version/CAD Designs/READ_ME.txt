Important!

All CAD Designs were created using SOLIDWORKS Students Edition

Each labware designed comes in 3 different file formats:

1) Solidworks Format
2) STL Format
3) HSV (Cubicon Style 3D Printer) Format

- For editing, use SOLIDWORKS Students Edition
- Use HSV if printing labware directly using Cubicon 3D Printers
- Else, use the STL Format to slice the design into whatever other format other 3D Printers use
